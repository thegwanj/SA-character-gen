## Pre-Code
For this app, the basic concept is to be able to create a character sheet for SA. This includes names, skills, trees, and other information that a regular character sheet would have. It should also be able to show the user how much xp will be needed for the concept, if any. This will allow users to not only create their existing characters, but new ones as well. In short, we can boil it down to this user story:

```
AS a player at SA
I WANT an online character sheet maker
SO THAT I can see and keep track of my character concepts
```

## MVP
In order for the project to be "successful," we will need to create a Minimum Viable Product, or MVP. We can consider the MVP complete when we meet the following criteria:

```md
GIVEN a character sheet web application
WHEN I open the web application in the browser
THEN I am shown the option to create a character
WHEN I go to create a character
THEN I am directed to a form that allows me to input information about my character, including name, faction, sub-faction, and more
WHEN I have finished submitting my input
THEN I should see the new sheet displayed to me
```
