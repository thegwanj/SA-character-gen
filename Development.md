## Pre-Code
For this app, the basic concept is to be able to create a character sheet for SA. This includes names, skills, trees, and other information that a regular character sheet would have. It should also be able to show the user how much xp will be needed for the concept, if any. This will allow users to not only create their existing characters, but new ones as well. In short, we can boil it down to this user story:

```
AS a player at SA
I WANT an online character sheet maker
SO THAT I can see and keep track of my character concepts
```
