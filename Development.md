# Ideas for Development
This is a document for laying out plans for this app. Plans may be subject to change at any time for any reason. Credit will be given to those that have their idea on this sheet.

## Changelog
This section will be for logging more major changes made to the development plan itself. The above section will not be modified unless needed.

```md
Implementing saving and public deployment into the MVP as it is a needed step
Moving all but editing feature from post-MVP into the MVP
Moved the changelog up top so it is easier to see the changes right away
```
## Pre-Code
For this app, the basic concept is to be able to create a character sheet for SA. This includes names, skills, trees, and other information that a regular character sheet would have. It should also be able to show the user how much xp will be needed for the concept, if any. This will allow users to not only create their existing characters, but new ones as well. In short, we can boil it down to this user story:

```
AS a player at SA
I WANT an online character sheet maker
SO THAT I can see and keep track of my character concepts
```

## MVP
In order for the project to be "successful," we will need to create a Minimum Viable Product, or MVP. We can consider the MVP complete when we meet the following criteria:

```md
GIVEN a character sheet web application
WHEN I open the web application in the browser
THEN I am shown the option to create a character
WHEN I go to create a character
THEN I am directed to a form that allows me to input information about my character, including name, faction, sub-faction, and more
WHEN I have finished submitting my input
THEN I should see the new sheet displayed to me
```

Addtional items that were moved into the MVP:
- Public deployment so anyone can access the site at any time
- Saving character sheets (Nathan J, Joey S)
- Dynamically show xp costs when making the sheet (Community Feedback)

## Post-MVP
Once we have established our MVP, we will look at adding some additional functionality. Some of that includes:
- Allow for editing of sheets once completed (Nathan J)

## Post-Development
Once we have finished our MVP and added in some additional functionality, we would have made the app we have set out to make. From then on, all future development is mostly for quality of life. Some of these developments might include:
- Links to lore (Nathan J)
- Power/skills "cheat sheet" (Nathan J)
- User creation
    - Collaboration/editing permissions
- Create "Demo" sheets for users to see and use example sheets (Joey S)
- XP optimization (Kieran G)
- Dynamic themes depending on faction (Joey S)

This section is most likely to keep changing as development goes on as we receive feedback from users
