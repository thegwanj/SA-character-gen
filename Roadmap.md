# Roadmap
This document highlights the main goals for each phase of production. Unlike the items in [Development](./Development.md), the items here will be set and will rarely change, if ever. All items must be complete in each phase before moving on. Since items here will pretty much be set in stone once put in, it might look like we don't have a lot planned for future phases. If you're curious about ideas for future development, please go and check out the [Development](./Development.md) document for more info.

We currently have four phases of development: Prototype, Alpha, Beta, and Release. Each phase might go through several versions before moving on to the next phase. To check on what changes through each update, please check out the [Changelog](./Changelog.md) document.

## Prototype
- Create a simple file system to work on
- Create a basic database system to store sheets
- Create a script(s) to handle user input and bring in some basic interactivity

## Alpha
- Start to dynamically show options as the user goes through the process
- Start to dynamically handle rendering the sheet based off of the faction chosen
- Add in basic input functionality for most stats and items
- Basic styling for better reading and accessibility
- Basic cleanup of code for better optimization

## Beta
- TBD

## Release
- TBD
